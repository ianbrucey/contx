# Complex Task: User Login Endpoint Implementation

## 1. Problem Definition
**Problem Statement**: The application currently lacks a secure user authentication system. Users cannot log in, and there's no mechanism to protect routes or maintain user sessions.

**Business Context**: User authentication is critical for the task management application. Without it, we cannot implement user-specific features, protect sensitive data, or provide personalized experiences.

**Current State**: No authentication system exists. All routes are public and there's no user management.

**Desired State**: Secure login endpoint with JWT-based authentication, password hashing, rate limiting, and proper error handling.

**Success Criteria**: Users can securely log in with email/password, receive JWT tokens, and access protected routes.

**Stakeholders**: Development team, product manager, end users

## 2. Solution Objective
**High-Level Approach**: Implement RESTful login endpoint using JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing, and Redis for rate limiting.

**Key Components**:
- Login API endpoint (`POST /api/auth/login`)
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password verification with bcrypt
- Rate limiting middleware
- Error handling and logging
- Input validation and sanitization

**Integration Points**: 
- User service for user lookup
- Redis for rate limiting and session management
- Database for user credential verification
- Frontend authentication state management

**Expected Deliverables**:
- Secure login endpoint
- JWT middleware for route protection
- Comprehensive test suite
- API documentation
- Security audit checklist

**Timeline Estimate**: 3-4 days across multiple sessions

## 3. Strategic Rationale
**Why This Solution**: JWT tokens provide stateless authentication that scales well with our microservices architecture. bcrypt ensures secure password storage. Redis rate limiting prevents brute force attacks.

**Architectural Alignment**: Fits with existing Node.js/Express API structure and PostgreSQL database. Aligns with planned microservices separation.

**Future Enablement**: Foundation for:
- OAuth integration
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session management
- User role-based permissions
- API key authentication

**Technical Debt Considerations**: Establishes security patterns for future authentication features. Creates reusable middleware for other services.

**Scalability Impact**: JWT tokens enable horizontal scaling without session storage dependencies. Redis rate limiting scales across multiple API instances.

**Maintainability Impact**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated auth middleware. Comprehensive logging for security monitoring.

## 4. Research & Discovery
**Codebase Analysis**:
- Files to modify:
  - `src/routes/auth.js` (create new auth routes)
  - `src/middleware/auth.js` (create JWT validation middleware)
  - `src/middleware/rateLimiting.js` (create rate limiting)
  - `src/models/User.js` (add authentication methods)
  - `src/utils/jwt.js` (create JWT utilities)
- Files to create:
  - `src/controllers/authController.js` (login logic)
  - `src/validators/authValidators.js` (input validation)
  - `tests/auth.test.js` (comprehensive test suite)

**Technology Decisions**:
- New dependencies:
  - `jsonwebtoken` v9.0.0 (JWT token handling)
  - `bcrypt` v5.1.0 (password hashing)
  - `express-rate-limit` v6.7.0 (rate limiting)
  - `joi` v17.9.0 (input validation)
- JWT algorithm: HS256 (symmetric signing)
- Token expiration: 15 minutes access, 7 days refresh
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP

**External Dependencies**:
- Redis for rate limiting storage
- PostgreSQL for user credential storage
- Environment variables for JWT secrets
- Logging service for security events

**Risk Assessment**:
- Technical risks:
  - JWT secret exposure (High) → Use environment variables, rotate regularly
  - Timing attacks on password comparison (Medium) → Use bcrypt.compare()
  - Rate limiting bypass (Medium) → Implement multiple rate limiting strategies
- Business risks:
  - User lockout from aggressive rate limiting (Medium) → Implement progressive delays
  - Performance impact from bcrypt (Low) → Use appropriate salt rounds
- Timeline risks:
  - Complex security requirements (Medium) → Start with MVP, iterate

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive security testing
- Code review with security focus
- Progressive rollout with monitoring
- Fallback authentication mechanisms
