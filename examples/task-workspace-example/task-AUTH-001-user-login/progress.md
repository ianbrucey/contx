## Session Log
### Session 1 - 2024-02-01 09:00-11:00 (2 hours)
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Accomplishments**: 
  - Task workspace created and structured
  - Completed comprehensive task definition
  - Researched JWT libraries and security best practices
  - Identified all code files and dependencies
- **Decisions Made**: 
  - Chose jsonwebtoken library over jose for better documentation
  - Decided on 15-minute access token expiration
  - Selected bcrypt with 12 salt rounds for password hashing
- **Blockers Encountered**: None
- **Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 implementation - JWT utilities

### Session 2 - 2024-02-01 14:00-16:30 (2.5 hours)
- **Duration**: 2.5 hours
- **Accomplishments**:
  - Implemented JWT utility functions (generate, validate, refresh)
  - Created password hashing utilities with bcrypt
  - Set up basic Express route structure for auth endpoints
  - Added environment variable configuration for JWT secrets
- **Decisions Made**:
  - JWT payload includes userId, email, and role
  - Refresh tokens stored in Redis with 7-day expiration
  - Error responses follow existing API error format
- **Blockers Encountered**: 
  - Redis connection configuration needed clarification
  - Resolved by checking existing Redis setup in user service
- **Next Steps**: Complete login endpoint logic and input validation

## Time Tracking
| Session | Date | Duration | Focus Area | Progress Made |
|---------|------|----------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | 2024-02-01 | 2.0h | Planning & Research | Task definition, technology decisions |
| 2 | 2024-02-01 | 2.5h | Core Implementation | JWT utilities, password hashing |
| 3 | [Planned] | 2.0h | Login Endpoint | Complete Phase 1 |
| 4 | [Planned] | 3.0h | Security Features | Rate limiting, validation |

**Total Time Spent**: 4.5 hours  
**Estimated Remaining**: 5.5 hours  
**Original Estimate**: 24-32 hours (3-4 days)

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components
- ‚úÖ **JWT Utilities** (`src/utils/jwt.js`)
  - Token generation with configurable expiration
  - Token validation with error handling
  - Refresh token management
- ‚úÖ **Password Utilities** (`src/utils/password.js`)
  - bcrypt hashing with 12 salt rounds
  - Password verification with timing attack protection
- ‚úÖ **Environment Configuration**
  - JWT_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET variables
  - Token expiration configuration
  - Redis connection settings

### In Progress Components
- üîÑ **Login Endpoint** (`src/routes/auth.js`)
  - Basic route structure created
  - Need to implement request handling logic
  - Input validation pending
- üîÑ **Auth Controller** (`src/controllers/authController.js`)
  - File created, login logic in progress
  - User lookup and password verification needed

### Pending Components
- ‚è≥ **Input Validation** (`src/validators/authValidators.js`)
- ‚è≥ **Rate Limiting Middleware** (`src/middleware/rateLimiting.js`)
- ‚è≥ **JWT Middleware** (`src/middleware/auth.js`)
- ‚è≥ **Error Handling** (Enhanced error responses)
- ‚è≥ **Security Logging** (Authentication event logging)

## Blockers and Issues

### Resolved
- ‚úÖ **Redis Configuration**: Clarified connection settings by reviewing existing user service setup
- ‚úÖ **JWT Library Choice**: Selected jsonwebtoken after comparing with jose and node-jsonwebtoken

### Current
- None

### Potential Future Blockers
- **Database Schema**: May need to add fields to users table for authentication metadata
- **Frontend Integration**: Will need to coordinate token storage and refresh logic
- **Rate Limiting Storage**: Need to confirm Redis instance capacity for rate limiting data

## Key Insights and Learnings

### Technical Insights
- JWT payload size impacts performance - keeping minimal with userId, email, role
- bcrypt salt rounds of 12 provide good security/performance balance for our use case
- Redis TTL for refresh tokens automatically handles cleanup

### Process Insights
- Task workspace structure is very helpful for maintaining context between sessions
- Breaking down complex tasks into phases makes progress tracking much clearer
- Decision logging prevents re-debating already resolved questions

### Security Considerations
- Timing attack prevention is crucial for password verification
- JWT secret rotation strategy needs to be planned before production
- Rate limiting needs to account for legitimate users behind NAT/proxy

## Next Session Preparation

### Immediate Tasks (Session 3)
1. Complete login endpoint request handling
2. Implement input validation with Joi
3. Add user lookup and password verification
4. Test basic login flow end-to-end

### Session 3 Goals
- Complete Phase 1 (Core Authentication Infrastructure)
- Begin Phase 2 (Security and Rate Limiting)
- Have working login endpoint that returns JWT tokens

### Preparation Needed
- Review existing user model structure
- Confirm database connection patterns used in project
- Prepare test user accounts for testing

## Notes
- Consider implementing progressive rate limiting (increasing delays) instead of hard blocks
- May want to add login attempt logging for security monitoring
- Frontend team should be notified about JWT token structure for integration planning
